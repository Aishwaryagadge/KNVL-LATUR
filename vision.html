Kamla Nehru High School's- Vision & Mission</font>
<br>
<font color="red" size="5" face="Castellar">The Best School In Latur  Where Knowledge Is Goal
</font> 
<br>
<p>
Our primary goal at Kamla Nehru High School (SSC, Latur) which is the best school in Baroda,<br>
 is to impart quality education that will nurture academic excellence of the highest class and community thinking.<br>
 We believe that each child has specific in-born talents and it is the school’s responsibility to identify and foster <br>
these talents so that the child’s natural gifts are realized to their highest potential and thus develop compassionate world<br>
 citizens, who are committed to living with responsibility, learning with enthusiasm and balancing a strong work culture with a sense of play.<br>
<br>
 

We strive to offer true education that teaches and imbibes universal values and morals, builds courage, instills self-confidence,<br>
 and fosters a sense of responsibility in the children, which makes Nalanda International School the best school in Baroda.<br>
 They are given a proper understanding of their rights and duties as citizens and taught to respect points of view of other people.
<br><br>
 

At Nalanda International School Baroda, we believe the basic value of life is life itself. This defines the sacredness of human<br>
 life and with it, the physical security which every parent, school, community, and the society owe to their children. <br>
It also acknowledges the right of every person irrespective of age, sex, colour, creed, nationality and religion to live with dignity.<br>
 At Nalanda International School Baroda, we make every effort to provide an environment conducive to the learning and internalizing of <br>
these values, which helps us to maintain the position of being the best school in Baroda.
<br><br>
 

Education should be able to fulfill a larger role than imparting knowledge and skill, it should be able to instill character and values<br>
 into our children. An authoritarian education can virtually diminish a child’s innate curiosity. At Nalanda International School Baroda we<br>
 follow a more liberal style of education, which promises encouragement and freedom for children to think and act individually, making Nalanda <br>
the best school in Baroda. We create ample opportunities to identify and fulfill academic, cultural, sporting and social potential through the various <br>
paths of learning. We ensure that our students attain skills and attitudes for life in a rapidly changing world. We make every effort to provide a creative,<br>
 humane and dignified environment for our children to learn and grow into good human beings, proud Indians and successful future world citizens and to acquire<br>
<br> habits of curiosity, reflection, mental flexibility, independence and self discipline.<br>
