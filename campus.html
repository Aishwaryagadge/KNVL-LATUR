Campus And Infrastructure at Nalanda School Vadodara<br>
Imparting quality education needs the right ambience. A school building is not made of just brick and stone but planning and love.<br>
 A great deal of thought has gone into transforming brick walls and concrete slabs into the beautiful buildings of Nalanda International School.<br>
 The school has four buildings, each of them retaining the school's chief architectural style of exposed brick, yet designed age specifically.<br>
 The chief features include open spaces, arches, a bell tower, long corridors, play areas, seating areas, elements that embellish the premises<br>
 and the specific rooms that are allotted for the specific activities. The school is a proud recipient of the LEAF Award in the year 2006 in a <br>
highly commended category for the use of traditional methods of environmental control. Nalanda was selected by the ‘LEAF Forum’ for LEAf Awards - 2006.<br><br>

The sprawling campus is lush green and welcoming. Here you can hear the tweeting of birds, see butterflies and peacocks! In the lap of nature,<br>
 the process of teaching - learning unfolds.. Short treks in the orchards inside the campus, teaching in the open classrooms and other open areas,<br>
 help students to stay connected with nature. Apart from buildings the campus has trees, plants and flowers creating a beautiful natural environment to study.<br><br>


 

 

The school has been able to not just decide what to study but also WHERE to study! And the ambience created with beautiful landscaping is perfectly <br>
conducive to education.<br><br></font>
