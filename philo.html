<b>Philosophies at Nalanda international school</b>
<ul>
<li><b>100% Participation</b> – In all big events of Nalanda International School, the school ensures 100% participation by all students.<br> 
We believe that each child has an inherent set of skills and targets as each student is unique. This philosophy ensures that every<br>
 child makes relevant contribution – whether big or small – to school events</li>.<br><br>

<li><b>Good Citizenship</b> – The final purpose of true education is to nurture responsible future citizens of the country and the world.<br>
 Keeping this in mind, Nalanda International School’s programmes are designed to instill values of civic importance and democratic qualities.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Values and Virtues</b> – Education is not complete without the correct values and virtues being instilled. Apart from striving for <br>
academic and co-curricular brilliance, Nalanda International School also emphasizes value based education to create better, well rounded individuals for future.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Transport for All</b> – In an age when gizmos and gadgets rule the world and when material possessions and branding have become so important,<br>
 Nalanda International School ensures uniformity in its transport system in order to avoid unwanted comparisons among students. This results in many<br>
 moments of bonding and togetherness among friends and mentors.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Parents as Partners</b> –To ensure regular interaction and communication between the teachers and the parents for the holistic education of the child,<br>
 Nalanda International School has programmes like Home Visits and Parent Educator Meetings.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Holistic Development</b> – Education is not gained from books alone and should not stop at the classroom door. At Nalanda, we believe that students <br>
should be exposed to a range of co-curricular activities like Sports, Art, Dance, Drama and Music in order to groom students as well rounded citizens of the future.<li><br><br>

<li><b>Discipline</b> – Young students need a clear set of rules and values for a proper upbringing. Nalanda believes that its set of rules of discipline is<br>
 not the absence of freedom, but rather a clear set of guidelines for model behaviour. Good discipline ensures that students grow up in an environment of order<br>
 and efficiency.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Punctuality and Regularity</b> – Time and tide wait for none… Nalanda strongly believes in this adage and this is evident in its punctual transport system<br>
 and the timely starting and completion of all school events. Learning and imbibing of a new skill or virtue each day can be achieved only with an emphasis on<br>
 attendance and regularity and that is why Nalanda stresses on it.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Emphasis on Morals, Ethics and Values </b>– In an ever changing world the relevance of morals, ethics and values is more than ever before.<br>
 Through its events, programmes and school culture, Nalanda educators work hard to inculcate values like honesty, integrity, dignity of labour, equality <br>
and good manners.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Strictly No Tuitions</b> – The onus of imparting education should rest with the school and thus Nalanda has a strict ‘No Tuition’ policy.<br>
 Students are discouraged to go for private tuitions of any kind since tuitions are only a burden and do not serve the true purpose of schooling and<br>
 education but rather may cause damage to the study patterns of students.</li><br><br>
